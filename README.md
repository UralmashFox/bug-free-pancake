This is my first homework for Fundamentals of Robot Programming.
The goal was to create approximately model of spot robot (body and 4 legs, each consisting of 2 parts).
Firstly, open the archive and locate "spot" folder in the home directory.
Secondly, open the terminal and paste: "source spot/devel/setup.bash" to run setups".
In the end launch the model with the comand in one line: "roslaunch spot/src/myrobot/launch/display.launch".
After these manipulations Gazebo opens and shows the model.
Programm contains xacro for minimization of the code (includes building of legs and describing of joints).
